## Description

This project is a basic implementation of the Tetris game in Python. It uses the `pygame` library to create a graphical user interface and handle game mechanics. The game includes core features of Tetris, such as controlling and moving Tetrominoes, clearing lines, and tracking the player's score.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tetris-python.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd tetris-python
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

## Usage

Run the game using the following command:
```bash
python tetris.py
```

## Controls

- **Left Arrow**: Move Tetromino left
- **Right Arrow**: Move Tetromino right
- **Down Arrow**: Move Tetromino down faster
- **Up Arrow**: Rotate Tetromino
- **Space**: Hard drop Tetromino

## Gameplay

The goal of the game is to clear as many lines as possible by forming horizontal rows of blocks. When a row is completely filled, it is cleared, and the player's score increases. The game ends when Tetrominoes stack up to the top of the screen.

## Features

- Classic Tetris gameplay mechanics
- Simple and intuitive controls
- Score tracking
- Line clearing

## Future Enhancements

This project serves as a basic implementation of Tetris. Future enhancements could include:

- Levels with increasing difficulty
- Different Tetromino shapes and colors
- Sound effects and music
- High score tracking
- Pause and resume functionality
